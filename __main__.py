#TO DO:
# We need a win and lose condition. I'm thinking we put something just after our word and or guessed letters print before we have them guess a letter to check and see if they won or lost. 
# If they did, I think we would print a win or lose message and stop the loop.
# That will be done using the self.parachute_condition variable in director.py
